Did you like this content and want to contribute? We'd love your help! This way we'll be able to build a really relevant content, which is not only useful to beginners but for everyone!

Our targets are:

- Be easy to read and interpret
- Write examples

### How to contribute

To make easier our jobs with contributions and revisions, there's a need to be organized so we can avoid possible errors:

1. Fork the project
2. Create a branch to add your contribution
3. Add only one command and/or definition per Pull request
4. Open a pull request

#### Note ####

By `only one command`, we mean add only one file at a time. Each file will contain a single command and/or definition and will be part of a single PR.

E.g: `rm` command should be within a `rm.md` file within the `content/` directory of the project. This file will become a single pull request.

### Organization

When you add a new command, create a markdown file, i.e. `rm.md` and, in this file, you should explain the definition.
The `README.md` contains only the Table of Contents, so there's no need to change that file.

That is, when you contribute with a new command

1. Create a file for the command, i.e. ```rm.md```.
2. Open a Pull Request with the title "[New] your-command"

That's it! Easy isn't it?
